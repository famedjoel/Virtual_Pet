# Virtual Pet

Installation Process

---
In this Virtual Pet, you can be able to interact with or rather play with.


** first of all if you want to start the project/code you have to use this link 
https://github.com/famedjoel/Virtual_Pet.git.

** Then after clicking the link you have to be able to extract the code because it is in a zip file.

** After extracting go to the designated code editor of your choice but I will recommend Visual Studio Code then open the folder where your extraction is stored then the folder of the code/project will appear.

** I was able to create a server which you can see from '/server.mjs'. to start it, just go to the terminal and type "npm start" then it will pop and you are good to go.

So after starting the server, I believe the pet is up and running. I created a name input box where you can name the pet and you will receive a good welcome alert then click ok.

# Features

3. Feed the Pet if hungry
4. It can sleep
5. Play a game with the pet if you want

# Description of the Features
1. Play with the Pet: As can you see from the '/script.mjs', I have put some comments to show you what each part of the play code does. so going to our server just click the button and its hand raise up and come down.
   
2. Clean the pet to keep it hungry and healthy: As can you see from the '/script.mjs', I have put some comments to show you what each part of the clean code does. It basically shows that I created a function so that the meter decreases but when you click the button it increases over some seconds.

3. Feed the Pet if hungry: As can you see from the '/script.mjs', I have put some comments to show you what each part of the feed code does. It basically shows that I created a function so that the decreases but when you click the button it increases.

*I was able to make sure that if you don't feed the pet it will die of hunger and if it does so an alert will be shown to you and how long it lasted then refresh the page to start again but please feed it if you do not want it to die.

4. It can Sleep: As can you see from the '/script.mjs', I have put some comments to show you what each part of the sleep code does. It basically shows that I created a function so that the meter decreases but here is the tricky part if you click the button the pet falls asleep for a second or so(you can see that from the eye closing) then it will open then blink for some seconds after.

5. Play a game with the pet if you want: Here comes the fun part of this pet platform.  As can you see from the '/game.mjs', I have put some comments to show you what each part of the game code does. Basically, I created a game called "Roshambo or Rochambeau" It is basically called rock, paper, and scissors. Try your luck and you will win if not it may be a tie or the pet wins but the box disappears after some seconds though.

**Note: I created something for the happiness of the pet and you can see the code at '/script.mjs'.Basically, the happiness meter depends on the state of if it is clean, if it has energy, and if it has been fed well. You can touch the function values and it reduces (normally I did everything to be at 100 but if you tamper with the values you will see it reduce) but you can do it from the VS code platform or rather code editor platform.


The pet CSS which is at '/style.css' just basically show you the kind of design I did with various part of the pet, buttons, meter, etc.

Wish I was able to put more features or designs in the Virtual Pet to fascinate your bubbles but this should be okay and quite enjoyable.
