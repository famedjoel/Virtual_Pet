Installation Process

---
In this Virtual Pet, you can be able to interact with or rather play with.


*first of all if you want to start the project/code you have to use this link 
https://github.com/famedjoel/Virtual_Pet.git
*then after clicking the link you have to be able to extract the code because it is in a zip file.
*After extracting go to the designated code editor of your choice but I will recommend Visual Studio Code then open the folder where your extraction is stored then the folder of the code/project will appear.
*I was able to create a server which you can see from server.mjs
