Installation Process

---
In this Virtual Pet, you can be able to interact with or rather play with.


*first of all if you want to start the project/code you have to use this link 
https://github.com/famedjoel/Virtual_Pet.git.

*then after clicking the link you have to be able to extract the code because it is in a zip file.

*After extracting go to the designated code editor of your choice but I will recommend Visual Studio Code then open the folder where your extraction is stored then the folder of the code/project will appear.

*I was able to create a server which you can see from 'server.mjs'. to start it, just go to the terminal and type "npm start" then it will pop and you are good to go.

So after starting the server, I believe the pet is up and running. I created a name input box where you can name the pet and you will receive a good welcome alert then click ok.
